godot can supposedly import .blend files direcltly. if it cant, let me know and I will export an FBX, but directly loading the .blend is preferable.

the model contains 2 materials. Katana_dif needs to be set up with the corisponding texture file. Katana_out needs to be set to black. this is the outline.
